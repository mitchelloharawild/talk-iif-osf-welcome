Now we have many R packages available that are widely used, a burgeoning number of Python packages, and a few Julia packages, along with C or C++ implementations of ETS, ARIMA and other well-known models.

    "text": "Designing extensible forecasting frameworks\n\n\nA well-designed interface is instrumental in making software easy to learn and use. The design of statistical software is inherently subjective, and there are many difficult decisions involved in creating interfaces that work cohesively within the intended domain. A forecasting framework sets out the design language for the forecasting workflow, guiding users conceptually about how different steps relate to one another. Making each element of the workflow extensible enables developers to implement new models, accuracy metrics, or other forecasting techniques that can be immediately used in conjunction with other forecasting elements. In this talk, I will examine the design decisions made when creating fable, the tidy time series forecasting successor of the forecast package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell O'Hara-Wild\nPresenter\n\n\n\nTony Bagnall\nDiscussant"

    "text": "FoReco: From foundations to frontiers\n\n\nIn many forecasting applications, producing multiple time series forecasts across different aggregation levels (such as regions, product categories, or time scales) is both common and necessary. However, independently generated forecasts often fail to respect the underlying constraints linking these series, leading to inconsistencies that can compromise decision-making analyses. Forecast reconciliation addresses this challenge, while preserving or even improving forecast accuracy. FoReco is a dedicated open-source R package that systematically implements forecast reconciliation approaches, providing robust tools for obtaining coherent forecasts in a multivariate setting. It supports hierarchical, grouped, and general linearly constrained time series, and implements both classical and modern reconciliation approaches, including bottom-up, top-down, middle-out, and optimal combination methods. Its main features include full support for cross-sectional, temporal, and cross-temporal reconciliation, availability of both projection and structural formulations, and a wide range of flexible covariance matrices based on sparse structures. Additional features include methods for non-negative reconciliation, reconciliation under immutable constraints, and both point and probabilistic forecast reconciliation using parametric or non-parametric approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniele Girolimetto\nPresenter\n\n\n\nCharupriya Sharma\nDiscussant"

    "text": "Probabilistic forecast reconciliation with bayesRecon\n\n\nForecasts generated for each series in a hierarchy often violate aggregation constraints. The packages bayesRecon (R) and bayesreconpy (Python) implement probabilistic forecast reconciliation via conditioning for hierarchical time series. Our packages reconcile probabilistic forecasts to ensure coherence across the hierarchy. They support different types of base forecasts: Gaussian, continuous non-Gaussian, discrete. They also support mixed hierarchies with discrete and continuous forecasts on different levels. The interface is unified across both languages, and the packages are released under an LGPL (≥3) license. This presentation will introduce the software and demonstrate core functionalities with both R and Python short tutorials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLorenzo Zambon\nPresenter\n\n\n\nAnubhab Biswas\nPresenter\n\n\n\nOlivier Sprangers\nDiscussant"

It merges ARIMA and ETS and extends them by implementing explanatory variables, supporting multiple frequencies, and mixture distributions for intermittent demand. ADAM supports a variety of distributions, including Normal, Generalised Normal, Inverse Gaussian, Gamma and others. It allows users to estimate models using a variety of techniques, including regularisation, recursive and direct strategies, and supports custom loss functions, offering flexibility for research purposes. It also supports a variety of ways to produce forecasts for different situations. ADAM is implemented in the smooth package for R. It is agnostic of the provided data and works with vectors, ts, zoo, tsibble classes, together with matrix, data.frame, data.table and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKandrika Pritularga\nPresenter\n\n\n\nAdam Wang\nDiscussant"

    "text": "Integrating Smooth Capabilities into Python\n\n\nThe smooth package provides a comprehensive state-space framework for forecasting, centered on the Augmented Dynamic Adaptive Model (ADAM). ADAM offers a unified structure that integrates and extends classical time series models like ETS, ARIMA, and regression beyond their standard implementations. Originally developed within the R statistical environment, the growth of Python’s forecasting ecosystem motivated the development of a native implementation for its expanding community of researchers and practitioners. This presentation focuses on the engineering specifics of implementing the smooth framework in Python. We explain the architecture, which utilizes the original C++ backend, and detail the refactoring process used to transform the initial translation into an idiomatic, object-oriented Pythonic API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilotas Theodosiou\nPresenter\n\n\n\nPablo Montero-Manso\nDiscussant"

The talk also critically examines the trend of gated forecasting models, where core capabilities are locked behind APIs or proprietary layers, which is seeing an especial proliferation around so-called “foundation models”, versus fully open-source implementations of the same technologies.\nBy the end of the session, participants will leave with a nuanced understanding of the strengths, trade-offs, and pitfalls in the current Python forecasting ecosystem, and practical guidance for selecting tools aligned with their organizational values and technical requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnirban Ray\nPresenter\n\n\n\nFranz Király\nPresenter\n\n\n\nChristoph Bergmeir\nDiscussant"
