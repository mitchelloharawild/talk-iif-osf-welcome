The design of statistical software is inherently subjective, and there are many difficult decisions involved in creating interfaces that work cohesively within the intended domain. A forecasting framework sets out the design language for the forecasting workflow, guiding users conceptually about how different steps relate to one another. Making each element of the workflow extensible enables developers to implement new models, accuracy metrics, or other forecasting techniques that can be immediately used in conjunction with other forecasting elements. In this talk, I will examine the design decisions made when creating fable, the tidy time series forecasting successor of the forecast package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell O'Hara-Wild\nPresenter\n\n\n\nTony Bagnall\nDiscussant"

    "text": "FoReco: From foundations to frontiers\n\n\nIn many forecasting applications, producing multiple time series forecasts across different aggregation levels (such as regions, product categories, or time scales) is both common and necessary. However, independently generated forecasts often fail to respect the underlying constraints linking these series, leading to inconsistencies that can compromise decision-making analyses. Forecast reconciliation addresses this challenge, while preserving or even improving forecast accuracy. FoReco is a dedicated open-source R package that systematically implements forecast reconciliation approaches, providing robust tools for obtaining coherent forecasts in a multivariate setting. It supports hierarchical, grouped, and general linearly constrained time series, and implements both classical and modern reconciliation approaches, including bottom-up, top-down, middle-out, and optimal combination methods. Its main features include full support for cross-sectional, temporal, and cross-temporal reconciliation, availability of both projection and structural formulations, and a wide range of flexible covariance matrices based on sparse structures. Additional features include methods for non-negative reconciliation, reconciliation under immutable constraints, and both point and probabilistic forecast reconciliation using parametric or non-parametric approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniele Girolimetto\nPresenter\n\n\n\nCharupriya Sharma\nDiscussant"

Our packages reconcile probabilistic forecasts to ensure coherence across the hierarchy. They support different types of base forecasts: Gaussian, continuous non-Gaussian, discrete. They also support mixed hierarchies with discrete and continuous forecasts on different levels.

The talk also critically examines the trend of gated forecasting models, where core capabilities are locked behind APIs or proprietary layers, which is seeing an especial proliferation around so-called “foundation models”, versus fully open-source implementations of the same technologies.\nBy the end of the session, participants will leave with a nuanced understanding of the strengths, trade-offs, and pitfalls in the current Python forecasting ecosystem, and practical guidance for selecting tools aligned with their organizational values and technical requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnirban Ray\nPresenter\n\n\n\nFranz Király\nPresenter\n\n\n\nChristoph Bergmeir\nDiscussant"

    "text": "Forecasting 2.0: A Framework for Near-Optimal Time Series Forecasting and Inference via Pre-Trained Models\n\n\nWe introduce a new framework for time series modeling that approximates optimal performance in both forecasting and inference. Implementations are available in both R and Python. We will present the underlying statistical and software design principles—what we call a grammar for optimal time series model design. Traditional models such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing rely on estimation techniques like Maximum Likelihood, which do not directly optimize for forecast error or bias. This disconnect is even more pronounced in tasks such as model selection and model combination, where optimality is rarely addressed.\nOur framework leverages neural networks trained on simulations of time series models to act as near-optimal estimators and forecasters tailored to specific optimality criteria. A suite of pre-trained networks is provided as drop-in replacements for classical estimators commonly found in statistical software. These networks, even when approximating simple statistical models, achieve state-of-the-art performance on major time series benchmark datasets—outperforming both traditional estimators and more complex neural architectures, including foundation models.\nThe framework is highly extensible, making it easy to adapt to non-Gaussian distributions, complex nonlinear dynamics, censoring, time-varying parameters, and other scenarios that are easy to simulate but intractable analytically. Importantly, the entire framework is fully open: all model weights, architectures, training data, and pipelines are open-sourced and designed to be trainable on consumer-grade hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo Montero-Manso\nPresenter\n\n\n\nKandrika Pritularga\nDiscussant"

However, our expertise primarily lies in computer science and machine learning rather than forecasting specifically, and we have not previously published in the forecasting field.

    "text": "Hierarchical Forecast Reconciliation on Networks: A Network Flow Optimization Formulation\n\n\nThe problem of hierarchical forecasting with reconciliation requires that we forecast values that are part of a hierarchy (e.g.~customer demand on a state, district or city level), and there is a relation between different forecast values (e.g.~all district forecasts should add up to the state forecast). State of the art forecasting provides no guarantee for these desired structural relationships. Reconciliation addresses this problem, which is crucial for organizations requiring coherent predictions across multiple aggregation levels. Current methods like minimum trace (MinT) are mostly limited to tree structures and are computationally expensive for large-scale problems. We introduce FlowRec, which reformulates hierarchical forecast reconciliation as a network flow optimization problem, enabling forecasting on generalized network structures and relationships beyond trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharupriya Sharma\nPresenter\n\n\n\nDaniele Girolimetto\nDiscussant"

    "text": "Context-Aided Forecasting: Progress So Far and Next Big Challenges\n\n\nClassical and modern forecasting models based on numerical data have seen widespread success in a range of applications. While historical numerical data and engineered covariates provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can flexibly be communicated through natural language. My talk will be on this setting of “context-aided forecasting”, where the goal is to produce statistical forecasts by incorporating all relevant context in natural language. I will first discuss our efforts on building CiK (short for “Context is Key”), a forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, with a strict requirement for models to integrate both modalities to produce accurate forecasts. I will discuss the Region-of-Interest CRPS, a proper scoring rule we propose, which prioritizes context-sensitive windows and accounts for constraint satisfaction. We evaluate a range of approaches on CiK, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings, especially with respect to efficiency. I will also present new results on the benchmark, including simple methods that improve the zero-shot performance of LLMs through forecast-bootstrapping and in-context learning. Next, I will discuss other efforts from the community on benchmarks and methods for context-aided forecasting, and expand on our ongoing work on hybrid methods combining time series foundation models and LLMs for accurate and efficient context-aided forecasting. Finally, I will discuss the next big challenges in this space, centering around building interactive, agentic systems for forecasting and analysis and their potential in democratizing powerful forecasting tools, making them significantly more accurate and accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArjun Ashok\nPresenter\n\n\n\nJoaquin Amat Rodrigo\nDiscussant"
