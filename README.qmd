#### Abstract

In the field of forecasting, the use of open-source forecasting software has become increasingly prevalent
throughout the entire forecasting workflow. These tools have played a pivotal role in democratizing access
to advanced forecasting capabilities. While forecasters often switch between forecasting tools as needed, the
development of these tools typically occurs in relative isolation. To improve collaboration across forecasting
software, we are delighted to propose an IIF-sponsored workshop that unites developers to share and
discuss the latest ideas in forecasting software.
